## Hangman

[Version 1](https://dakodablue.github.io/Hangman-Game/index1.html)
This version and the 2nd are the most complex.  All are compiled from other peoples code and I did my best to try add comments above each live to explain what they do.  This one has a scss preprocessor included which may or may not work on Github.  On click, no keyboard.  Also has categories with corresponding arrays and hints for each 'safe word'.

[Version 2](https://dakodablue.github.io/Hangman-Game/index2.html)
Event Key utilized along with some nice jquery fades, etc.  Better visualization of tallies/scorekeeping.  Again restyled and commented.

[Version 2](https://dakodablue.github.io/Hangman-Game/index3.html)
Definitely most barren of the 3, but I suppose the most akin to the demonstration video provided via GitLab (minus the 80's flare and tunes if I recall correctly).  Watched pre recorded 'live' youtube video and wrote pages along with streaming host.
